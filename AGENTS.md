# Repository Guide

## Working rules

- Prefer small, verifiable changes.
- Use short-lived branches for meaningful changes.
- Check `git status --short` before and after edits.

## Verification

- Run the smallest relevant checks for the files you changed.


## DESIGN.md workflow

- Keep repository-level `DESIGN.md` as the source of truth for look-and-feel constraints used by AI agents.
- For front-end tasks, read `DESIGN.md` before implementation and follow its token, component, state, and responsive rules.
- If the repo has a web app (for example `web/` or `apps/web/`), also read that web app's `DESIGN.md` and `docs/ui-acceptance-checklist.md`.
- Do not clone third-party brand styles directly from public references; adapt with project-approved tokens and product intent.
- Before finalizing UI work, run narrow code checks and at least one browser visual verification pass.
